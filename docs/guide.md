# Getting Started

**vue3-marquee** is a simple marquee component for Vue 3 that creates customizable marquees. This component uses slots for your content and props for any config options.

## Introduction

`vue3-marquee` was born from an internal need for a quick and easy marquee component that I wanted to use in our website homepage. Many of the component libraries that I found were either unmaintained, complex or not compatible with Vue 3. This component should also work for you if you would like to use a marquee component that just works out of the box and is customizable to fit your use case.

In my search for a good marquee component, I found a React library that seemed to do what I wanted so I decided to emulate the component in Vue 3 for anyone to use. The original React library can be found [here](https://www.react-fast-marquee.com/).

In `vue3-marquee` you have the option of cloning content to remove any empty spaces for marquee elements that don't fit the width of the container. This will allow you to have seamless content that just works.

## Changes from v2

With version 3, native TypeScript support has been added.

::: info Upgrade guide

- If you are importing the component in your main.(js|ts) file (via the `use` syntax), you don't have to modify this statement. However you will need to now import a css file as well.
- If you are using a local import, you will need to convert your `import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'` to `import {Vue3Marquee} from 'vue3-marquee'`. You will need to now import a css file as well.

## Playground

You can use the already setup code sandbox to play around with the library and test out the funcionality. [Use this link to go to the playground](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue3-marquee-sandbox-09zm5?file=/src/App.vue).

# Installation and Usage

## Vue 3

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

- Register the component in your Vue 3 application.

The most common use case is to register the component globally.

```js
// main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

createApp(App).use(Vue3Marquee).mount('#app')
```

If needed rename component to use:

```ts
app.use(Vue3Marquee, { name: 'Vue3Marquee' }) // use in template as <Vue3Marquee />
```

- `name` string (default: 'Vue3Marquee') - set custom component name

Alternatively you can also import the component locally.

```js
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
```

You can then use the component in your template

```vue
<template>
  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>
</template>

<script>
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
</script>
```

## Nuxt 3

:::warning
This is still experimental. Will need to be tested extensively and will be updated as I find more use cases.
:::

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

- Create a folder called **`plugins`** at the root of your project.
- Create a file named **`Vue3Marquee.client.ts`** inside the _plugins_ directory.
- Add the following code to the **`Vue3Marquee.client.ts`** file.

```js
import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Vue3Marquee)
})
```

This should register as a global component that you can call anywhere in your app under the `<Vue3Marquee>` tag.

- Import the css file required by the component into your **`app.vue`** file.

```js
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'
```
